# 📱 My Portfolio - Mobile Application Development (MAD)

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to my **Mobile Application Development Portfolio**! This repository showcases a collection of apps and projects built using **React Native**, **Node.js**, and **Expo Go** as part of my MAD coursework. Each folder represents a unique milestone — from UI design tasks to full-stack app implementations.

This README is your complete guide to the apps, their features, how they were built, and how to run them.

## 📁 A1 - UI Design: Ticket Booking App

### 🎯 Objective

Design a beautiful and intuitive UI for a ticket booking application using **Figma** and implement it in React Native.

### 📸 Key Screens

- Splash Screen
- Login / Sign Up
- Ticket Search
- Booking Confirmation

### 🌈 Design Tools

- **Figma** for prototyping
- Used color schemes based on [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)

---

## 📁 A2 - API Integration

### 🎯 Objective

Integrate REST APIs into a mobile app using Node.js backend and fetch real-time data into React Native frontend.

### 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

- **Express.js** for creating APIs
- **Axios / Fetch** for client-side integration
- **Postman** for testing endpoints

### 🔐 Features

- Login / Signup using backend auth
- Data fetch from external/internal APIs
- CRUD operations on user data

---

## 📁 MID Exam Project

A full-stack mobile app developed during the midterm exam with basic authentication, navigation, and data operations.

- Navigation using `@react-navigation/native`
- Backend handled with Express and MongoDB
- Implemented local storage fallback

---

## 📁 Quiz1

### 🧪 Concepts Practiced

- State & Props
- Components & Styling
- Hooks (useState, useEffect)

---

## 📁 Quiz2

### 🚀 Improvements Added

- Stack Navigation
- AsyncStorage
- Improved UI with better structure

---

## ▶️ Running the Projects

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tanveer-hub570/My-Portfolio.git
```

2. Navigate into any project folder:
